      "description": "At OSU-MGR we distribute thousands of sediment and hard rock samples on an annual basis to researchers all over the world. As an NSF-OCE-MGG funded facility, the OSU-MGR (and therefore PI’s who curate their samples) is bound by the NSF-OCE data policy for NSF-OCE funded projects. Samples from cores and sediment traps, information on sampling stations, and descriptions of materials from the OSU collection are provided to qualified scientific investigators upon receipt of well-documented requests. Materials for educational purposes and museum displays may also be available in limited quantities.",

      "description": "The collection includes more than 22 miles of oceanic sediment cores and tens of thousands of marine rock specimens that provide scientists an archive of Earth’s history, including changes in climate, biology, volcanic and seismic activity, meteorite interactions and more. In 2017, the university was awarded stewardship of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean National Collection of Rock and Sediment Cores, which had been housed at Florida State University, by the National Science Foundation. The Florida State collection was transferred to Oregon State via 14 50-foot refrigerated semi-trucks over the summer of 2019.",

      "description": "The Oregon State University Marine and Geology Repository (OSU-MGR) is a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded repository that hosts the OSU Marine Geology and Geophysics collection and the Antarctic Core Collection. OSU moved its existing collection from storage on campus to the new 33,000 ft² facility that includes 10,900 ft² of refrigerated core storage, 11,600 ft² of dry rock storage and a 550 ft² walk-in freezer. The facility is well equipped to run major sampling parties, research programs, and educational endeavors. Laboratory space is available for analytical activities including scanning tracks for physical properties and elemental analyses.",
